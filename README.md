Make this version work:
=======================

1.) Download this repo, via --> Code --> Download ZIP

2.) unpack the Zip. You will got a folder called "PrusaSlicer_v2.8-main".

3.) inside this folder, you need to:

   > unpack "=RAW_PrusaSlicer_ROAMING=.zip" to "_PrusaSlicer_ROAMING" 

   > unpack "PrusaSlicer_DLL.zip" to "PrusaSlicer.dll" 

4.) delete both *.zipÂ´s, if you like

5.) go into the subfolder "resources" and unpack:

   > "resources.zip.001"

   which outputs many subfolders

6.) delete both "resources.zip.001" & "resources.zip.002", if you like

7.) go back to the root-folder & start "prusa-slicer_START.bat" as admin, 
    which automates the process of linking your "Roaming"-Folder "PrusaSlicer" 
    whereever you move your PrusaSlicer App or use a different Computer, for 
    example.

**(This steps where needed, because GitHub dont allow you to upload files that are bigger than 25MB, via Browser)**
